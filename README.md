I am a junior data scientist with 4+ years’ experience in data analysis with advanced knowledge of Python, Stata and MySQL. I posses ability to communicate complex data and findings in an articulate manner as evidenced by written work for which numerous awards and grants have been received. 

I recently graduated from Practicum by Yandex data science bootcamp. During the intense 9 months learning journey I completed 15 real-life projects and used a range of techniques from data pre-processing, exploratory and statistical data analysis to machine learning algorithms such as regressions, decision tree, random forest, boosting techniques, computer vision, machine learning for text, unsupervised learning and so on. 

I also hold a PhD in applied economics, though which I gained advanced statistical skills, problem solving approach and critical thinking. 

I am fluent in Macedonian, Greek and English.
